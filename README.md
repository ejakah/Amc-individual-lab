Project Title: Implementation of a Cloud-Based Web Application Deployment Strategy on Amazon Web Services (AWS) Utilizing Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), GitHub Version Control, Docker Containerization, Kubernetes Orchestration, and Ngrok Tunneling with Kubernetes Load Balancing.

# Project Description:
This project aims to demonstrate the deployment of a web application to the cloud utilizing modern DevOps
practices, such as creating Virtual Private Cloud (VPC). The application will be hosted on a Kubernetes cluster and
made accessible via a Kubernetes Load Balancer service with the integration of Ngrok. This project serves to
exemplify the end-to-end deployment process, encompassing aspects such as code version control,
containerization, and Kubernetes orchestration.

# Project Objectives:
This academic project aims to investigate and illustrate the deployment of a web application in a cloud
environment. Specifically, it will focus on the utilization of modern DevOps practices, Virtual Private Cloud (VPC),
Elastic Load Balancing, Kubernetes orchestration, and the enhancement of external accessibility using Ngrok
tunneling and Kubernetes Load Balancing. The goal is to provide a detailed exploration of deploying a Cloud-Based
Web Application Strategy on Amazon Web Services (AWS), employing GitHub Version Control, Docker
Containerization, Kubernetes Orchestration, and Ngrok Tunneling.




# Project Architecture:
The architecture for the implementation of a Cloud-Based Web Application Deployment on AWS consists of
several key components that work together to deploy, manage, and serve a web application in the cloud. It
leverages AWS services, Kubernetes, and DevOps best practices to achieve a robust and scalable infrastructure.
Here's an overview of the project's architecture:
# 1. Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): 
The foundation of the architecture is the AWS VPC, which provides a private
network environment. It includes public and private subnets, route tables, and security groups. The VPC
isolates resources and controls network traffic.
# 2. GitHub Repository: 
The project source code is hosted on a GitHub repository. It serves as the central version
control system and collaboration platform for the development team.
# 3. Docker Containerization: 
The web application is containerized using Docker. A Dockerfile is used to define
the application's container image, which is stored in a container registry, such as Docker Hub.
# 4. Kubernetes Cluster: 
A Kubernetes cluster, deployed on AWS (e.g., minikube), orchestrates and manages the
application's containers. Kubernetes provides features for scaling, updating, and ensuring fault tolerance.
# 5. Kubernetes Load Balancer:
 A Kubernetes LoadBalancer service is established to distribute incoming traffic
across multiple instances of the Web application. This enhances high availability and fault tolerance.
# 6. Ngrok Tunneling: 
Ngrok, or an equivalent solution, is employed to provide secure external access to the web
application. It creates a tunnel between the public internet and the Kubernetes LoadBalancer service.
# 7. Monitoring Solution: 
A comprehensive monitoring solution, such as AWS Grafana or CloudWatch, is
implemented to track the performance and health of the deployed application.
## Kubernetes Load Balancer Investigation with Hostname-based Visualization
The Load Balancer Investigation is aimed at enhancing the monitoring and analysis of a web service in load
balancing scenarios. The primary objective is to create a visual indicator that changes the background color of the
web page based on the hostname used to access the service. This allows for immediate identification of whether a
different container or host has responded to a request, facilitating efficient load balancing configuration and
troubleshooting.
# 1. Visual Identification: 
Develop a feature to change the background color of the web page based on the
hostname used for access.
# 2. Hostname-Based Background Color Change:
 Implement a mechanism (algorithm) to dynamically change the
background color of the web page based on the hostname.
# 3. User-Friendly Interface: 
Design an intuitive and user-friendly interface that clearly conveys the relationship
between hostname and background color.
# 4. Debugging and Monitoring: 
Facilitate load balancing configuration, monitor, and debugging by visually
indicating the responding host or container.
#Benefits:
▪ Quickly identify changes in the serving infrastructure, ensuring an even distribution of requests
across containers or hosts.
▪ The Load Balancer Investigation aims to enhance the efficiency of load balancing scenarios by
introducing a visual indicator that changes the background color of the web page, based on the
hostname. This feature will facilitate load balancing analysis and debugging, making it easier to
identify changes in the serving infrastructure. The project will be implemented following the defined
scope, and comprehensive documentation will be provided to support users in effectively utilizing
the feature.
 Milestones
To ensure a structured and manageable progression of our project, the following four milestones have been
defined:
# Milestone 1: VPC and GitHub Setup
# Objective: 
Establish the AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) with public and private subnets, route tables, and
security groups. Set up the GitHub repository for version control.
# Tasks:
• Create an AWS VPC.
• Configure public and private subnets.
• Set up route tables and security groups.
• Create a GitHub repository for the project.
# Milestone 2
• Code development
• Clone project code from our GitHub to Linux machine.
# Milestone 3:
 Docker Containerization and Kubernetes Cluster Setup
# Objective: 
Containerize the web application using Docker. Deploy a Kubernetes cluster (minikube) for container
orchestration.
# Tasks:
• Develop a Dockerfile to containerize the application.
• Build a Docker image of the web application.
• Deploy a Kubernetes cluster within the chosen cloud environment.
• Configure the kubectl tool for interaction with the cluster.
# Milestone 4: 
Kubernetes Deployment and Load Balancer Integration
Objective: Develop Kubernetes deployment YAML files for the web application, initiate the deployment, and
integrate a Kubernetes Load Balancer service for efficient traffic distribution.
# Tasks:
• Create Kubernetes deployment YAML files specifying resources, environment variables.
• Initiate the deployment of the web application to the Kubernetes cluster.
• Set up a Kubernetes LoadBalancer service for external access.
# Milestone 5: 
Ngrok Tunneling and Monitoring Implementation
# Objective: 
Configure Ngrok for secure external access and implement a monitoring solution (e.g., AWS Grafana or
CloudWatch) to track application performance.
# Tasks:
• From Kubernetes load balancer service, configure Ngrok to provides an accessible HTTP link.
• Set up monitoring tools and dashboards for application performance monitoring.
These milestones provide a structured approach to the project, with each stage building upon the previous one.
Completion of these milestones will lead to the successful deployment of a cloud-based web application on AWS
using modern DevOps practices.
